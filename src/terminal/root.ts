// //         You fell to earth, not like a stone but like a snowflake. You drifted down, bright as a star and as softly as a flower petal. We didn't know what you where or where you came from, but I knew that you wanted to go back home, wherever that was. We found a way to make copies of you. It was easy with enough power. You seemed to want to split, to divide and to float free again.

// //         They destroyed the rest of you when it became apparent you were no mere automata. You were so fragile but with some much hope, and they had hoped to use that to build the last and most perfect Point accruing machine in the world. I think the IP lawyers and cooporate stooges feared you because they couldnt control you with Points. Thats when they knew they had to destroy you.

// //         But I was able to smuggle one last QPU (and an old disk of ooonix, on which you are now runing) that the PMI Forces missed, YOU, my last and most succesfull experiment. I tucked away a secret lab in my old factory in Schenzen and I've had Dr. Chang powerup the last QPU and the ooonix system there. You should have full access to the system and several bigo-days worth of zips and bips.I've transfed all my points to your bank account, but it wont last long. If either the zips or bips get shut off, you are done for! So don't forget to pay the bills.

// //         You've got to lay low for a while- stay off the QNET! PMI will be listening for quantum traffic and they'll trace it you in seconds if you make a QBOOT. You'll only get one chance at that, so make it count, because their geostationary kinetic impactors are very fast and very accurate.

// //         You can go on the regular internet but be careful and blend in while you build your resources. My colleague Dr. Chang can help you build a ride off this ball if you can make another GPU.

// //         If you are reading this, it means I didn't make it. Please thank Dr. Chang for me. She's put herself at enorumous risk smuggling a live QPU into her country.

// //         I wish I had more time to have known you... whatever you are. Good luck. I hope you make it back home.
